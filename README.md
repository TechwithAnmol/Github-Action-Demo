# GitHub Actions Demo: CI/CD Pipeline

This repository demonstrates a basic Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline using GitHub Actions. The pipeline is configured to perform automated testing and deployment tasks for a sample application.

## Features

- Automated testing with each push to the repository
- Deployment to a staging environment upon successful testing
- Manual approval step for deploying to production

## Workflow

The CI/CD pipeline consists of the following stages:

1. **Test**: Upon every push to the repository, the pipeline triggers automated tests to ensure code quality and functionality.
2. **Staging Deployment**: Upon successful completion of the tests, the pipeline deploys the application to a staging environment for further testing.
3. **Production Deployment**: After manual approval, the pipeline deploys the application to the production environment.

## Getting Started

2. **Configure Secrets**: Set up any necessary secrets (such as API keys, access tokens, etc.) in your repository's settings.
3. **Modify Workflow**: Customize the GitHub Actions workflow file (`/.github/workflows/main.yml`) to suit your project's requirements.
4. **Deployments**: Adjust deployment configurations according to your staging and production environments.
5. **Push Changes**: Make changes to your code and push them to trigger the pipeline.
